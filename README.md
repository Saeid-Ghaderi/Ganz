# Domain Driven Design(DDD) and Clean Architecture with ASP.NET Core and C# - Microservice approach

## 🚀 Overview
This project is built on the principles of **Clean Architecture** with a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** approach. It is specifically designed to support **microservices** development, providing a robust and scalable structure for modern distributed systems.

---

## 🔑 Features
- 🧑‍💻 **Clean separation of concerns** with distinct layers.
- 💡 **Adherence to DDD principles** for domain modeling.
- 🛠 **Designed for microservices**, promoting modularity and scalability.
- 🔄 **Easy to maintain** and extend.

---

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

The solution follows the **Clean Architecture** structure:

### 1. **Domain Layer** 🏢
   - Contains the **core business logic** and **entities**.
   - Free of **external dependencies**.

### 2. **Application Layer** 📝
   - Includes **use cases** and **application logic**.
   - Interacts with the **domain layer**.

### 3. **Infrastructure Layer** 🌐
   - Handles **external concerns** like **databases**, **APIs**, and **message brokers**.

### 4. **Presentation Layer** 📱
   - Provides entry points such as **APIs** or **UI interfaces**.
