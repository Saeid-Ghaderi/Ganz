Clean Architecture - DDD - Microservice

## Overview
This project is built on the principles of **Clean Architecture** with a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** approach. It is specifically designed to support **microservices** development, providing a robust and scalable structure for modern distributed systems.

## Features
- Clean separation of concerns with distinct layers.
- Adherence to DDD principles for domain modeling.
- Designed for microservices, promoting modularity and scalability.
- Easy to maintain and extend.

## Architecture Overview
The solution follows the Clean Architecture structure:

1. **Domain Layer**
   - Contains the core business logic and entities.
   - Free of external dependencies.
2. **Application Layer**
   - Includes use cases and application logic.
   - Interacts with the domain layer.
3. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Handles external concerns like databases, APIs, and message brokers.
4. **Presentation Layer**
   - Provides entry points such as APIs or UI interfaces.
